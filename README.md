# Proximity

Proxitmity is a python application that maintains a listing of homes for sale, and, accepts a listing/home and returns similar listings nearby.

Currently, the app searches for all listings that are in neighboring zip codes and are nearly the same size (~same number of bathrooms/bedrooms)

This could perhaps be improved to look for same/similar dwelling type etc.
